Welcome to a11y First! I'm a social worker who codes and I have become increasingly interested in accessibility practices in web development but also how it directly impacts some of the people with whom I get to work. Inspired by [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) I wanted to create a central place for accessibility supports for both web developers and myself as someone who works firsthand with people who can benefit from a11y practices.

This is a work in progress, but I welcome any and all PR's for a11y resources! Hopefully this will allow for others to contribute to Open Source, but also to learn more about accessibility and increase awareness about the need for developers to build with accessibility in mind.

For starters, I'm working to include a collection of resources from [Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com/) who works with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) my favorite tool to develop with at the moment. Marcy is an advocate for inclusion on the web and I've found a lot of the information she posts super helpful.

This site uses the Gatsby Starter Gitbook Starter from Hasura.io. Below is original documentation from starter to aid in development. Ideally, I would like to split the site into what is helpful for individuals with disabilities and their families and then also resources for helpful information for web developers learning about a11y.

# gatsby-gitbook-starter

Kick off your project with this starter to create a powerful/flexible docs/tutorial web apps.

##Motivation

We wanted to create a [GraphQL tutorial](https://learn.hasura.io) series. The content would be written by developers for various languages/frameworks and what better than writing it in Markdown! And since this is a tutorial series we also needed rich embeds, syntax highlighting and more customisations.

We also wanted to serve these tutorials in sub paths of [learn.hasura.io](https://learn.hasura.io). To serve all these requirements, we decided to use Gatsby + MDX (Markdown + JSX) to extend markdown and used a neat consistent theme like the one at [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and deployed as docker containers.

## üî• Features

- Write using Markdown / [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- GitBook style theme
- Syntax Highlighting using Prism [`Bonus`: Code diff highlighting]
- Search Integration with Algolia
- Google Analytics Integration
- Automatically generated sidebar navigation, table of contents, previous/next
- Edit on Github
- Fully customisable
- Rich embeds and live code editor using MDX
- Easy deployment: Deploy on Netlify / Now.sh / Docker

## üîó Live Demo

Here's a [live demo](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/react)

## üöÄ Quickstart

Get started by running the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:tpage99/a11yfirst.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.

## üîß Configure

Write markdown files in `content` folder.

Open `config.js` for templating variables. Broadly configuration is available for `gatsby`, `header`, `sidebar` and `siteMetadata`.

- `gatsby` config for global configuration like

  - `pathPrefix` - Gatsby Path Prefix
  - `siteUrl` - Gatsby Site URL
  - `gaTrackingId` - Google Analytics Tracking ID

- `header` config for site header configuration like

  - `title` - The title that appears on the top left
  - `githubUrl` - The Github URL for the docs website
  - `helpUrl` - Help URL for pointing to resources
  - `tweetText` - Tweet text
  - `links` - Links on the top right
  - `search` - Enable search and [configure Algolia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/)

- `sidebar` config for navigation links configuration

  - `forcedNavOrder` for left sidebar navigation order. It should be in the format "/<filename>"
  - `frontLine` - whether to show a front line at the beginning of a nested menu.(Collapsing capability would be turned of if this option is set to true)
  - `links` - Links on the bottom left of the sidebar
  - `ignoreIndex` - Set this to true if the index.md file shouldn't appear on the left sidebar navigation. Typically this can be used for landing pages.

- `siteMetadata` config for website related configuration

  - `title` - Title of the website
  - `description` - Description of the website
  - `ogImage` - Social Media share og:image tag
  - `docsLocation` - The Github URL for Edit on Github

- For sub nesting in left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename and the sub navigation is auto-generated. The sub navigation is alphabetically ordered.

## Live Code Editor

To render react components for live editing, add the `react-live=true` to the code section. For example:

```javascript react-live=true
<button>Edit my text</button>
```

In the above code, just add `javascript react-live=true` after the triple quote ``` to start rendering react components that can be edited by users.

## ü§ñ SEO friendly

This is a static site and comes with all the SEO benefits. Configure meta tags like title and description for each markdown file using MDX Frontmatter

```markdown
---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
metaDescription: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs are generated automatically.
